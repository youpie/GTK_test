# Folder icon maker üìÅ

Folder icon maker lets you easily add images on top of a folder icon. It is mostly meant for Gnome. 
This application is my first attempt at creating an application using Rust and Libadwaita.

## Contributing ü§ù
This program is mostly meant as practise for me so I want to solve most problems by myself. So the best will be to create an issue if you encounter any.
If you want to create a merge request. That is off course totally fine, but please try not to fundamentally change how it works and clearly explain what you did and how it works üòÅ

## Running the app üèÉ
The app is currently not finished, so I have not released it anywhere yet. I do however plan to release it on flathub.
The easiest way to run the app is:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open it in [gnome-builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder)
3. Start the application by pressing `ctrl+shift+escape`
